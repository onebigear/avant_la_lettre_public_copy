# avant la lettre: media archaeology cn

Writing is a technology. Plato's Phaedrus is a classical reference that questioned the affordances of speech, writing, and rhetorics in a series of dialogues between Socrates and Phaedrus, an invented interlocutor to embody Plato's message in conversational form. In the conversation, Socrates regarded writing as a process alienating knowledge and soul from their essences; "Then he will not seriously incline to 'write' his thoughts 'in water' with pen and ink, sowing words which can neither speak for themselves nor teach the truth adequately to others?" metaphorically casted writing as a shallow, imperfect representation of knowledge and soul, profound and perfect in their essential Forms. Plato's critique towards writing is rooted in an idealist belief that all thoughts originated from the perfect Forms, and writing only produced an imperfect copy of thought, thus a twice mediated copy of a copy. 

Writing as a technology is not only a concern for the plane of metaphysics, but carries a unique materialist trajectory. The technological advancements that weave together a set of infrastructures to facilatate written words continue to enrich and contest Plato's phonocentrism - a neologism  refering to the superiority placed upon speech over writing. These advancements include more sophisticated techniques in paper production, and inventions that transformatively re-mediated writing processes, crudely put, typewriters and keyboard computers. As Matthew Kirschenbaum provided a grammatology of the hard drive as a storage device, writing technologies deserved a grammatological reading.  
	
Does phonocentrism lead to ethnocentrism? The alphabet is a basis from which the written word is organized by sequentially putting together symbols that correspond to a word as spoken. Such phonocentric correlation is limited to alphabetically mediated writing cultures. As a public program, _avant la lettre: media archaeology cn_ revolves around the culture and technology of Chinese written text, which is organized by visual pictograms. The program will take a look into how the technological developments made for circulating Chinese written text exist in relationship with their counterparts in the West, and how does the invention and usage of these writing technologies in turn condition the notion of race in a processual manner, rather than by definitive profiling with fixed parameters. 

The program is curated with three topics, repectively titled Hardware and Software, Input / Output, and Publishing Surfaces. Hardware and Software takes a preliminary look into archival projects dedicated for hardwares and the softwares developed and adapted during unique timeframes. Input / Output zooms into an historical and anecdotal episode revolving around Chinese Input and Output technology, which, in predominant scenarios, translates alphabetical keyboard inputs to pictogram based characters. Finally, Publishing Surfaces leaps to the intermedia publishing practices that directly or subtly reflects materialities of Chinese written text.
