# Archival Protocol

In order to minimize duplicated efforts, Biyi created a git repository to collect the raw materials that will be used to put together an archival publication for the program. Other file transfer tools (WeTransfer, Dropbox, email if filesize is small) are also welcomed. 


## Contents to upload:  
1. biography text. 
2. archival content, as image or as text.

## Folder structure 
```
$panelistName_archive/
├── images
│   └── work_img.jpg
└── text
    ├── bio.txt
    └── other_text.txt
```

__Folder__: $panelistName_archive

__Subfolder__: images, for images of work (from yourself or references) mentioned during the presentation. 

__Subfolder__: text, bio.txt (bio.txt as a placeholder file, you are welcome to upload a text file in other editable formats :). Please include other texts you'd like to include, for example texts about your work and research (i.e. introductory text on your work, notes, bibiliography, etc)

## Language Protocol
If you have your bio ready in both Chinese and English, please upload both versions. If one version is provided, Biyi can help with a translation with your final approval. 

## Help  
If there is anything unclear, please contact Biyi.
