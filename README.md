# avant la lettre: media archaeology cn

Language is a technology. Plato's Phaedrus is a classic reference that questioned the affordances of speech, writing, and rhetorics in a series of dialogues between Socrates and Phaedrus, a possibly invented interlocutor to embody Plato's message in conversational form. "Language is a technology" is not only a statement inserted on immaterial planes such as philosophy, but is deeply grounded in a materialist trajectory. In Phaedrus, Plato used material metaphors, albeit rudimentary, to refer to writing and speech as processes alienating knowledge and soul from their essences. "Then he will not seriously incline to "write his thoughts 'in water' with pen and ink, sowing words which can neither speak for themselves nor teach the truth adequately to others?" metaphorically contrasts the shallowness of written words and the profound irreplacable nature of knowledge and soul in their essential forms. The messages from Plato were not only to be contested and enriched by thinkers and the concepts that they've brought forth, most notably the concept of grammatology by Jacques Derrida, and further decomposition of writing by Vil√©m Flusser; but also by the technological advancements  that weave together an infrastructure to facilatate the circulation of written words. The infrastructure consisted of analog writing technologies such as paper, mechanical i/o technologies such as the typewriter, and digital i/o technologies such as the computer.

In the West, the written word is organized using the alphabet system, such as the Roman alphabet. In writing cultures mediated not by the alphabet, it is a whole different story. The program specifically revolves around the culture and technology surrounding the Chinese language. Organized by ideograms, the technological developments made for circulating Chinese text, exist in complex relationship to the West. The differentiations are both immaterial and material. Immaterial, as in how the ideogram writing system organize abstract thinking; material, as in how hardware developments in technology adapts to the ideogram writing system from prototypes that based on Western alphabets. Examples such as the early Chinese typewriter with ideogram inputs, and i/o systems developed since personal computing to transform QWERTY keyboard inputs to ideogram based characters. The choice to focus on a non-western writing technology is attempt to map out, how the conception of race may be technologically conditioned. Too often we know race as a definitive notion, associated with relatively fixed parameters: national and regional borders, biological traits, and cultural customs stereotypically performed by designated racial groups. The project is an attempt to unravel the notion of race with a processual, rather than the definitive manner, by choosing the Chinese writing technology as a field of investigation. "Avant la lettre" not only reflects that the project deals with "letters", but also refers to the diverse practices with relation to Chinese writing technologies in an archaeological manner, but may not have been formally presented or recognized by the Western media archaeology context. --->
