“Input / Output” serves as both an opening statement and lays out a foundational apparatus for the entire series of "avant la letter: media archaeology cn". The program invites two panelists, Zijie Li and Gehao Zhang, who both conduct research in Chinese input and output technology and materialize their output in the forms of theorization and publishing. 

Zijie Li is an alternative comics maker, typographer and an activist. "Chinese Word Processor: writing, power, capital and technology" is an ongoing research that embodies Zijie's interest in writing tools and writing environments. The work presents a narrative meandering through interwoven subjects and events: early entrepreneurial history of the Stone Typewriter as a piece of dusted public record; and the acclaimed novelist Wang Xiaobo's relationship to Chinese text processing by the ways of his self-programmed text editor, and family relation to a relative who was involved in the Chinese text input business. 

Gehao Zhang is an assistant professor in Macau University of Science and Technology. As a scholar in media archaeology, Gehao will lead us through a trajectory of Chinese text display development, as materialized by artifacts such as the analog Chinese typewriters and the hardware and software for digital Chinese text processing. Gehao will not only unravel a trajectory illustrated by rich material artifacts, but also lay out a interpretive framework coming from the most current theories from media archaeology.
